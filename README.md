The goal of this project is to build a web-based digital library search engine with a chatbot for electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The web-based user interface (UI) has a landing page containing a text box for users to search for ETDs indexed by Elasticsearch. When a user clicks one item in the search result page (SERP), a summary page shows up and displays metadata of an ETD, including its title, authors, year, university, advisor, discipline, and abstract. The summary page also contains a chatbot, which can answer questions on the content of corresponding ETD on the summary page. The chatbot is prepared using ChatGPT API.When the user leaves the summary page, the conversation history is automatically deleted.

The UI will implement other common features such as user registration, log-in, reCAPTCHA, spell-check, auto-complete, customized list, star rating, feedback, download, etc.
